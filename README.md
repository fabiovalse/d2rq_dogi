# D2RQ for LINKED DATA DoGi

[LINKED DATA DoGi]() is a bibliographic Linked Open Data source storing references about contributions published on Italian legal journals.

The DoGi initiative collects data from 1970 counting almost 400.000 contributions. A team of experts organize and preserve printed and digital juridical journals creating every 2 months around 15.000 new bibliographic resources.

Each resource is described by:
- bibliographic information enhanced with abstracts, summaries (ToCs and/or extended keywords);
- selection of legislative and jurisprudential references;
- one or more classification codes based on DoGi classification schema;
- other additional information related to the literary genres of the contribution analyzed.

The Linked Data DoGi project experiments Semantic Web technologies with a subset of data starting from 2000.

The project has been conducted by two institutes of the National Research Council: [Institute of Informatics and Telematics](http://www.iit.cnr.it/en) (in particular by the [WAFI group](http://wafi.iit.cnr.it/)) and the [Institute of Legal Information Theory and Techniques](http://www.ittig.cnr.it/en/).

The [D2RQ repository](https://github.com/d2rq/d2rq) has been modified in order to fulfil the requirements of the project.
